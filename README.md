# 🌱 Plant Seedlings Classification — Computer Vision with CNN

## 📌 Project Overview

In modern agriculture, identifying plant species and weeds manually is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, image classification techniques can now automate and significantly improve the speed and accuracy of plant seedling recognition.

This project aims to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically classify images of plant seedlings into **12 different species**, using a dataset released by Aarhus University Signal Processing group and the University of Southern Denmark.

## 🎯 Objective

- Develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify the species of a plant seedling from an image.
- Help automate plant classification in agriculture to reduce manual labor and improve efficiency.
- Contribute to the modernization and sustainability of farming practices.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of preprocessed image data and labels:

| File Name     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `images.npy`  | Numpy array file containing image data |
| `Labels.csv`  | CSV file mapping each image to one of 12 plant species |

### 🌿 Species Categories

The model will classify seedlings into the following categories:
- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common Wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet
